# Coding Storybook

## Project Description
For more than a decade, education researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders have recognized the importance of helping young people cultivate computational thinking, or the ability to use concepts from computer science to solve problems and understand the world in new ways (Wing, 2006). These concepts include how to think algorithmically, to break down complex ideas into smaller parts, or to uncover issues or “bugs” in instructions. 

While many technologies have emerged to support youth in exploring computational concepts and practices, opportunities in early childhood are especially promising to cultivate interests early in computing as well as to support the development of social, emotional, and cognitive milestones (Bers, 2017). Many studies have shown that early interventions can have compounding effects later in life and influence personal and academic outcomes (Shonkoff, 2017), such as helping mitigate barriers to participation in computing. 

Coding Storybook is a concept designed for young children around 5-7 to learn computational thinking through storytelling. The system includes a storybook and some electronics, such as servos, and a set of physical coding blocks. The characters and scene objects in each story can be torn down and assembled into 3D animals with electronics, then children can use a virtual programming interface (mobile or web based programming application) create a block of code to control the motion of the paper robot according to the storyline. Combining coding and storytelling in this concept not only makes traditional storytelling more interactive, but also makes computing more appealing and fun to young children.

This is a video about the following:
- Demonstration on the final model and demo;
- Process of building the model;
- Design of the storybook;
- Demo of the code, including the webcam function we finally could not utilize.

## Challenges & Limitation
The Topcode library could not be used for the project since the library does not have an Arduino equivalent as at the time of this project work and we could not find a better computer vision library that could read code blocks. While trying the project out, we used different resources most of which are not documented because we could not find success with them and eventually, we end up using a command prompt on the Arduino interface. Had it been possible, we would have loved to try out Arduino to Android communication or rather we try using a simple interface iOS app for the communication with the physical structure. 

While this is a course work, it should be noted that it is the project of Junnan and this project might explore the above listed solutions and likely, this page may be updated in the future.
