# Coding Storybook

## Project Description
For more than a decade, education researchers, policymakers, and industry leaders have recognized the **importance of helping young people cultivate computational thinking, or the ability to use concepts from computer science to solve problems and understand the world in new ways (Wing, 2006)**. These concepts include how to _think algorithmically_, to _break down complex ideas into smaller parts_, or to _uncover issues or “bugs” in instructions_. 

While many technologies have emerged to **support youth in exploring computational concepts and practices**, opportunities in **early childhood are especially promising to cultivate interests early in computing as well as to support the development of social, emotional, and cognitive milestones (Bers, 2017)**. Many studies have shown that early interventions can have compounding effects later in life and influence personal and academic outcomes (Shonkoff, 2017), such as helping mitigate barriers to participation in computing. 

**Coding Storybook is a concept designed for young children around 5-7 to learn computational thinking through storytelling.** The system includes a **storybook** and **some electronics**, such as servos, and a set of physical coding blocks. The characters and scene objects in each story can be torn down and assembled into 3D animals with electronics, then children can use a virtual programming interface (mobile or web based programming application) create a block of code to control the motion of the paper robot according to the storyline. Combining coding and storytelling in this concept not only makes traditional storytelling more interactive, but also makes computing more appealing and fun to young children.

## Project Components
- A Storybook
- A Physical Structure and
- Coding Blocks to be used for the sets of Instructions

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/degokay/Coding-Storybook/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/degokay/Coding-Storybook/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
